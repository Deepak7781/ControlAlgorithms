# Overview
This repository implements a variety of control algorithms applied to different physical systems. It serves as an educational and experimental framework for exploring classical and modern control theory in simulation and (potentially) real-world hardware setups. Whether you're a student, researcher, or engineer, this project helps bridge the gap between theory and practice by providing modular, extensible code for systems like inverted pendulums, quadcopters, and robotic arms.

## Key goals:

Demonstrate PID, LQR, MPC, and reinforcement learning-based controllers.

## Physical Systems
  - DC Motor
      - Armature controlled DC Motor
      - Field controlled DC Motor
  
- Servo Motor Position Control

- Ball and Beam System
